## AN EXAMPLE DATA SET
An example data set and transaction set can be found in association_rule_io.py. We describe how to run the program with it above.

## Additional Files
There are several additional data sets included with the project that the user can use instead of the example. The files containing these data sets each start with transactions. Their use is detailed above in the how to install and run the program section.
